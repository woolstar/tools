Code libraries, templates and executables

* btl

	The Bridge Template Library, getting C/C++ developers for old style C/C++ programming
	towards the goals of STL (RAII, generics, containers) while still giving "to the metal"
	access over memory allocation.

	Features static bound byte arrays, safe buffer "pointers", and a modern take on async
	networking and data handling (via channels).

	include, data, io

* ctl

	The cucumbered Polymorphic Template Library, for more efficient storage of polymorphic sets.
	Featuring list & vector with single allocation units.  Takes the goals of BTL to the next level.

* graphics

	In the 1990s I had one of the worlds fastest production raytracers, used for advertising
	work, high resolution print, television and film.  Easily a man-decade went into refining
	and expanding these tools, but I moved on to other fields.  Rescuing ancient archives now
	and trying to at least document my creations.

* bench
	benchmark flatset vs set in busy memory environment.
	(no surprise, flatset wins by a lot.)

* serialize
	Low level templates for assembling integral, strings, and structs into binary streams.
