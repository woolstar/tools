Code libraries, templates and executables

* btl

	The Bridge Template Library, getting C/C++ developers for old style C/C++ programming
	towards the goals of STL (RAII, generics, containers) while still giving "to the metal"
	access over memory allocation.

	include, data, io

* graphics

	In the 1990s I had one of the worlds fastest production raytracers, used for advertising
	work, high resolution print, television and film.  Easily a man-decade went into refining
	and expanding these tools, but I moved on to other fields.  Rescuing ancient archives now
	and trying to at least document my creations.
